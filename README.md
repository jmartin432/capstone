#UnicornWarp!

A capstone by Justin Martin

##Project Overview
Unicorns are lost in space and need to be rescued before they are eaten by 
Space Orcs. The player wanders around in space looking for resources that will 
him or her alive. When the player finds a unicorn the unicorn can be ridden to the 
nearest "unicorn warp" for teleportation.



##Functionality
Players enter the board alone and can encounter other players or game characters.
Players are in competition with each other to corral as many unicorns as possible.
WHen a player accumulates a certain amount of experience hey advance ot another level.



##Data Model
Game board will be fixed in size and 
quasi-randomly populated with Unicorns and Space Orcs and other characters

The player will have an character that can carry various weapons which have a 
balance of strengths and weaknesses. These characters will also have strength 
health levels that influence how they can interact with the game.

Other game characters will have strenghts and weaknesses as well as various weapons
and attack capabilites.




##Schedule
1. Create a single level around which a single player can move.
2. Add some unicorns that can be wrangled and taken to the unicorn corral.
3. Learn about websockets so I can add in a second player.
4. Players can work together or against each other to in this world
